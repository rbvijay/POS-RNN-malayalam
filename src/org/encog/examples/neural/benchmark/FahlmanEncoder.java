/**
 * This example implements a Fahlman Encoder.  Though probably not invented by Scott 
 * Fahlman, such encoders were used in many of his papers, particularly:
 * 
 * "An Empirical Study of Learning Speed in Backpropagation Networks" 
 * (Fahlman,1988)
 * 
 * It provides a very simple way of evaluating classification neural networks.
 *   Basically, the input and output neurons are the same in count.  However, 
 *   there is a smaller number of hidden neurons.  This forces the neural 
 *   network to learn to encode the patterns from the input neurons to a 
 *   smaller vector size, only to be expanded again to the outputs.
 * 
 * The training data is exactly the size of the input/output neuron count.  
 * Each training element will have a single column set to 1 and all other 
 * columns set to zero.  You can also perform in "complement mode", where 
 * the opposite is true.  In "complement mode" all columns are set to 1, 
 * except for one column that is 0.  The data produced in "complement mode" 
 * is more difficult to train.
 * 
 * Fahlman used this simple training data to benchmark neural networks when 
 * he introduced the Quickprop algorithm in the above paper.
